# rotate-layout

This project is a fork of
[rongi/rotate-layout](https://github.com/rongi/rotate-layout).

It has been forked a few years ago in order to fix a few minor issues and
has since been migrated to use Gradle as a build system.
We have maintained this version of the library for our own use.
The upstream project now has a few more features like rotation by
arbitrary angles, which we do not need at the moment. For us it's more
convenient and stable to use this version of the library than to test if
the upstream version has since been fixed and works well in our use-cases.
